## � The Story Behind the Project
It all started during the quiet winter shifts of my job as a night manager at a hotel. I had planned to tackle my gaming backlog, but I realized I’d left my rig (with its beloved 3070 Ti) behind. Armed only with a phone and tablet, I decided to dive into the Nintendo world I missed out on as a kid via emulation. I discovered *Fire Emblem* through a YouTuber playing *Engage*, and as a turn-based strategy fanatic, I was instantly hooked on *Awakening*.

The spark for this specific project, however, came from my girlfriend. We shared a ChatGPT account—she used it for studying, while I turned it into a specialized gaming assistant using its memory features. Naturally, my tons of "useless" gaming data started messing with her study sessions, and I was politely "evicted" from the account.

What began as a simple text file to track skills for creating "meta child units" quickly became unsustainable as my roster grew. So, during my shifts, I built this application using Antigravity. While I’ve dabbled with Firefox extensions before, this is officially my first "vibecode" application.

*I dedicate this project to Özge, who showed me what can be gained when life (or a girlfriend) forces you to fend for yourself. I love you.*

  ### The Story
  Working as a night manager at a hotel offers a lot of quiet time during the winter. Far away from my 3070 Ti rig and left with only a phone and tablet, I decided to dive into the Nintendo universe I missed out on as a kid through the magic of emulators. My journey into *Fire Emblem* began after seeing a streamer play *Engage*; as a turn-based strategy enthusiast, I was immediately hooked.

  The real catalyst for this project was my girlfriend "evicting" me from our shared ChatGPT account. While I primarily use Gemini and Claude, I loved turning ChatGPT’s memory system into a specialized assistant for my games. However, she needed the account for her studies, and my mountain of "unnecessary" game data was—understandably—getting in her way.

  What started as a humble text file to track "meta-children" and skill paths quickly became unsustainable as my roster grew. So, during my night shifts and with the help of **Antigravity**, I transformed that text file into this application. This is officially my first "vibecode" project.

  I dedicate this project to my beloved **Özge**, who showed me what one can achieve when pushed to stand on their own. I love you, honey.
